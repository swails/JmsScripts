FILES:
------

sans/   -- SANS parser package
   test.py -- SANS parsing example for NMR-STAR
ciftest.py -- ditto, for mmCIF

bmrb.py -- STAR object model implemented in python. Allows easy reading from STAR files and generating them programmatically.

INSTALL:
--------
sans parsers: simply copy sans subdirectory somewhere.

USE:
----

SANS:

Use ciftest.py and/or test.py as starting point.

if sans is a subdirectory in . : import sans
if sans is in /var/tmp/sans    : sys.path.append( "/var/tmp" )
                                 import sans

from sans STARLexer
from sans import ErrorHandler, ContentHandler*
from sans import *parser
 -- pick the content handler and parser you want to use:
  parser/cifparser need ContentHandler, parser2 needs ContentHandler2

Finally, write a handler class with methods that'll do something useful 
with the data.

BMRB:

Simply 'import bmrb' when you are in the same directory as this README. Make sure the sans folder is also present as it is a dependency.

It is easy to use 'help(bmrb)' in python to see the full range of what the BMRB module is capable of, but here are two examples:

Remove a saveframe from a STAR file that is read from the BMRB archive and then write it to disk:

ent15000 = bmrb.entry.fromDatabase(15000)
del ent15000['entry_information']
with open("/tmp/15000","wb") as f:
    f.write(str(ent15000))

Compare two entries for equivalence, using a syntax-aware checker. Then check one against the BMRB schema for validity:

ent15001 = bmrb.entry.fromDatabase(15001)
ent15000 = bmrb.entry.fromFile("/tmp/15000")
# Print differences between the two entries
bmrb.diff(ent15000,ent15001)
# Validate the first entry against the standard schema
bmrb.validate(ent15000)

DOCUMENTATION:
--------------
SANS is modelled after SAX parsers, if you know how those work look up 
the *Handler classes in sans/handlers.py and you should be all set.

To generate SANS documentation you'll need ant. Run "ant javadoc" in java 
subdirectory, then  look in java/doc/api.

Java documentation is not 100% accurate for python version, but the
descriptions of handler classes and parser basics are close enough.


BMRB:

Simply use python's built in help method on the BMRB class for the full documentation. The code is also well-commented if you need even more details on the module's operation than are provided in the built in help.

Also see the included PDF (PY-NMR-STAR.pdf) for an introduction.
